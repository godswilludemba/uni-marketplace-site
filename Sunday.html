      <p class="div-p"> Carrying out Transaction is frustrating, what i expect is not what i saw, it's easy to say is a scam, after registering with a huge amount they will be directing from one class to another, wasting data and time no income it's rubbish</p>

     <p class="div-p"> Haven't been here in years and so glad i decided to stop in on a busy weeknight. The Posting and managing listings are topnotch. However, you have to start over all the time.Also, when posting on Instagram and Facebook at the same time, it only shows preview for Facebook only. I don't really know if all this bugs have something to do with my type of phone, but I'm using itel S13. Good luck Uni-Market</p>

      <p class="div-p">It's really a great site but it shows a sign of bugs that needs fixes. I had to click the Search and Navigation bar many time before i could make purchase, and it seems not possible to add as many items on the list. You have to start over all the time.Also, when posting on Instagram and Facebook at the same time, it only shows preview for Facebook only. I don't really know if all this bugs have something to do with my type of phone, but I'm using a Samsung galaxy A22. Good luck Uni-Market</p>
